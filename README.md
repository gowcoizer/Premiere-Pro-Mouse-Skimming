# Premiere Pro Mouse Skimming
This is AHK script that holds down LMB for you and allows you to hover on the timeline without holding the LMB


After the script is executed click on your Playhead and it remains active while you move your cursor
Shift+F12 is the shortcut for enabling and disabling the script.

I have more scripts for one click changing speed of clips
One click importing files from File Explorer or directly from custom player (PotPlayer, AIMPlayer)
